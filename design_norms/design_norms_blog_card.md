# Component: blog card | v1

## Part A | Contract
**Purpose**: Preview a notebook article.

**Author input / fields**: `POSTS` entries: slug,title,date,tags,body,takeaways,project,sample,pr (optional).

**CSS scope / DOM hook**: `.note-card`, `.note-art`, `.note-body`, `.note-arrow`.

**Usage example**: See `component_examples.md` for copyable representations. Reuse current input type until a deliberate migration is documented. Do not require a page-specific wrapper inside this component contract.

## Part B | Look
145px cream artwork left, body padding ~18px, 2px hover lift and blue border; three-line title clamp.

**Dark / light**: All added styles must consume global semantic variables except the expressly allowed paper diagram palette. Typography and spacing follow global norms. Mobile should never cause horizontal page overflow.

**Variants**: Favor compact/large modifiers within this same file, not another component file. Existing variants, if any, remain separate until explicit consolidation.

**Edge cases**: No artwork: graceful fallback; no takeaways: default excerpt; long title clamp; phone stacks card.

**Do**: make content accessible; support theme switching, keyboard, mobile, reduced motion; check console after use.

**Do not**: introduce new fonts, leak CSS outside scope, run Python/C++ in the browser, or claim planned capabilities already work.

## Current source status
`row(p)` builds cards, including calculated reading time and hard-coded SVG variants.

## Shipping checks
- [ ] Dark + light
- [ ] Phone width and long content
- [ ] Keyboard / focus / accessible labels
- [ ] Reduced motion and no console exceptions
- [ ] No hard-coded colors beyond approved artwork

Changelog: 2026-11-08 | Initial documented contract/look; distinguish observed behavior from intended behavior.

**Next.js v2.1 implementation note (2026-11-08):** This norm defines design/behavioral intent. Its visible implementation currently remains in `public/legacy.html` (legacy hash router) presented through `src/components/LegacyPortfolio/index.tsx`; there is **no active matching native React leaf component**. When modifying this feature, consult `context_router.md` and `rules/nextjs_crud.md`, update the active HTML handlers/styles first, and validate all consumers listed in the sitemap. Any future isolated React component must preserve the same contract, responsive behavior and dark/light visuals before replacing the legacy fragment.
